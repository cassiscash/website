# Future Developments

The current iteration of Cassis is a very simple prototype, but one that can already go a long way on providing Bitcoin users with means to make payments. As time goes on, though, there are many things that can and should be built on top of the system to improve its the experience and safety in all directions. Other people will certainly come up with better ideas, but here are some:

More mundane, trivial improvements:

- More opcodes for allowing conditional payments that bridge Cassis with the Lightning Network or with other Cassis servers or allow for other interesting use cases.
- Allowing peers to charge routing fees.
- Keeping track of compounding interest on _trustline_ balances.

Long-term, fantastic developments:

- A way to hide the Cassis server log and state such that privacy is kept, but using **zero-knowledge proofs** that ensure all users that no shady or invalid transfers are happening.
- A decentralized system for **credit offers** and **repayment obligation contracts** between participants such that liquidity and trust can be more seamlessly injected into the system, and also such that trust is developed more among members of the society at large.
- The Cassis server becomes a [public service like **ICANN**](https://paulfrazee.medium.com/icanns-vs-blockchains-3ec91d1d9feb), neutral, cheap, and operated with transparency on behalf of the community.
